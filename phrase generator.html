                Welcome to the Random Passphrase Generator website. Use this website to create passwords 
                that are easy to remember but hard to guess.

            <p class="desc-header">What is a passphrase?</p>
            <p class="desc-text">
                A passphrase as a series of unrelated words that you can use as a password. 
                Three words are much easier to remember than a series of random characters, letters and numbers, 
                yet they are much harder to hack. Computer experts use passphrases whenever possible, and you should, 
                too!

            <p class="desc-header">Why use this website?</p>
            <p class="desc-text">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This site protects your information when communicating between the server and your browser, 
                        using HTTPS. Many sites don't do this, which makes the newly created password vulnerable to 
                        attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's easy to adjust your passphrase to meet common requirements. For instance, if spaces aren't 
                        allowed, you can replace them with dashes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can also add a number or special character, or you can uppercase part of the passphrase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you're ready to use your passphrase, just double-click to select it, rather than highlighting 
                        and copying it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="description3">
            <p class="desc-header">What should you do after you create a passphrase?</p>
            <p class="desc-text">
                The best way to keep track of your passwords is with a password manager. I recommend 1Password. While you 
                should never write your passphrase on a piece of paper, if someone did do that, a series random words is less 
                obvious than a traditional password.
